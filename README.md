# Github Releaser
Create new releases for your Github projects with this crappy bash script.

## Requirements
* [JSON.sh](https://github.com/dominictarr/JSON.sh)

## Installation
Add your username and token to the script and then just run the damn thing.

## Beware
Somewhat unstable. The script has some bugs (you can't add a tag description longer than ONE (1) word).
